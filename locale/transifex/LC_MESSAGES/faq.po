"Several materials have similar spectral signatures (e.g. soil and built-"

"can also use a :ref:`Signature_threshold_tab` for these signatures in "

"Yes, it is possible if all the images have the same number of bands. "

"(especially of vegetation state) will affect the spectral signature (i.e."
" the same pixel has different spectral signature in different periods). "
