"Developed by `Luca Congedo "
"<http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, the **Semi-Automatic "
"Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open source plugin for "
"`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the semi-automatic "
"classification (also known as supervised classification) of remote sensing "
"images. It provides several tools for the download of free images, the "
"preprocessing, the postprocessing, and the raster calculation (please see "
":ref:`other_0`)."

"<http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, **Semi-Automatic "
"Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) Ã¨ un open source plugin gratuito "
"per `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ che permette di effettuare una "
"classificazione semi-automatica (conosciuta anche come supervised "
"classification) di immagini remote sensing. Questo offre una serie di tools "
"per il download di immagini gratuite, il preprocessamento, il "
"postporcessamento e calcoli su raster (please see :ref:`other_0`)."

"The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of "
"intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic "
"workflow and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed "
"also by people whose main field is not remote sensing. The first version of "
"the :guilabel:`SCP` was developed by Luca Congedo in 2012 for the \"ACC Dar "
"Project\" in order to create a tool for the classification of land cover in "
"an affordable and automatic fashion; following versions of :guilabel:`SCP` "
"were developed as personal commitment to the remote sensing field and open "
"source philosophy. :guilabel:`SCP` version 6 (codename: Greenbelt) is "
"developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's PhD in Landscape and Environment at"
" Sapienza University of Rome."
